# Apply PKSG to SemEval2020T1

- PKSG code is available here: https://github.com/LeSaRDe/pksg
- The objective is to justify the efficacy of phrases in PKSG. 
- As most sentiment models are either not task-agnostic or binary, only positive and negative sentiments are considered. RoBERTa-based sentiment classifiers are fair enough for testing. And preliminary results showed that the accuracy can exceed 0.8.
